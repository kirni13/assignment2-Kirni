###### My favourite Team Sport is Table Tennis
I like Table Tennis, as it stimulates mental alertness to develop mental acuity and improves concentration.It improves the muscle movememnts and reflexes,It develops a good bond between the team players as it is played on a short board.I used to play in my school with my friends during sports hours and I really enjoy playing table tennis.<br>
The two important fundamental skills of table tennis are **forehand drives** and **backhand drives**.
